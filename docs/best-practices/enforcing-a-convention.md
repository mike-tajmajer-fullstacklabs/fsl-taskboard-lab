# Enforcing a convention — a takeaway card

Lab 2.b built one guardrail in this training repo. This card is for doing it in **your own**
codebase, where the conventions are yours and the stakes are real. It uses stored procedures as
the worked example because that's a rule many teams have written down and almost nobody checks —
but the shape applies to any convention.

Nothing here needs to be done in a lab. It's the independent follow-up; office hours will help.

## The shape: one rule, three layers

_(Layer numbers refer to Lab 2.b's five-layer model: 1 instruction · 2 client-side · 3
commit-time · 4 CI · 5 bypass. This card uses 1, 2, and 4 — commit-time hooks are skipped, and
the bypass appears inside layer 2's check.)_

Take a rule you already have. _"Stored procedures use parameters — never build executable SQL by
concatenating strings."_ Most teams have said this out loud. Very few can tell you when it was
last violated.

### Layer 1 — instruction

One line where the agent always sees it:

```md
- Don't: build executable SQL by string concatenation in a stored procedure — parameters only.
  Dynamic SQL requires `-- APPROVED-DYNAMIC-SQL: <reason + reviewer>`.
```

This informs. It does not enforce. Someone will ask for a flexible search and the agent will
concatenate, politely and with good intentions.

### Layer 2 — deterministic, while the code is being written

A `PreToolUse` hook that inspects the **content** of what's being written, not just the path.
That's the difference from a rule like "don't touch this file":

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
let raw = '';
process.stdin.on('data', (c) => (raw += c));
process.stdin.on('end', () => {
  let filePath = '',
    body = '';
  try {
    const p = JSON.parse(raw);
    filePath = p.tool_input?.file_path ?? '';
    body = p.tool_input?.content ?? p.tool_input?.new_string ?? '';
  } catch {
    process.exit(0);
  }

  if (!/\.sql$/i.test(filePath)) process.exit(0);
  if (/--\s*APPROVED-DYNAMIC-SQL:/i.test(body)) process.exit(0); // documented bypass

  const declaresBuffer = /DECLARE\s+@\w+\s+n?varchar\s*\(\s*max\s*\)/i.test(body);
  const concatenatesParam = /\+\s*@/.test(body);

  if (declaresBuffer && concatenatesParam) {
    console.error(
      [
        'BLOCKED: this procedure builds executable SQL by string concatenation.',
        'Why: concatenating a parameter into a statement is an injection path.',
        'Instead: pass values as parameters, or use a static statement.',
        'Done means: no parameter is concatenated into SQL text, or the file carries',
        '  `-- APPROVED-DYNAMIC-SQL: <reason + reviewer>`.',
      ].join('\n'),
    );
    process.exit(2);
  }
  process.exit(0);
});
```

### Layer 4 — the same rule at merge time

The hook stops the agent. This stops anyone:

```yaml
# in YOUR repo's CI — lint-sql.mjs is a script you write (~50 lines; it doesn't exist here)
- name: SQL conventions
  run: node scripts/lint-sql.mjs # same rule module the hook imports
```

**One rule module, two enforcement points.** Write the check once and call it from both, or the
two will drift and you'll trust the wrong one.

---

## Be honest about the false positives

The heuristic above has real ones. `sp_executesql` with a _static_ statement and bound
parameters is correct practice. A procedure that declares an `nvarchar(max)` for an unrelated
reason near a `+ @` trips it.

This isn't a flaw to fix before shipping — it's the decision you have to make:

- **narrow the trigger** and accept that some violations slip through, or
- **keep it broad** and route the noise to a nudge rather than a block, or
- **move the check to review** and stop pretending it's automated.

All three are legitimate. Silently shipping a broad blocking rule is not: the first time it
fires on real work, someone disables hooks, and you've lost the layer entirely.

## Which clauses can a gate actually decide?

Write your rule out and sort it before you write any code. This is the whole exercise — and this
table **is** the marking convention Lab 2.a's NFR asks for, with its three verdicts: mechanical,
partly (heuristic), and human-review.

| Candidate clause                                               | Mechanical?                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Header block present (Purpose / Params / Returns / Errors)     | Yes — structural                               |
| No `SELECT *` in a returned result set                         | Yes                                            |
| `SET NOCOUNT ON` as the first statement                        | Yes                                            |
| Writes wrapped in an explicit transaction with `XACT_ABORT ON` | Yes                                            |
| No `DROP`/`TRUNCATE`; no `DELETE`/`UPDATE` without a `WHERE`   | Yes                                            |
| Parameters only — no concatenation into executable SQL         | **Partly** — heuristic, expect false positives |
| "Purpose describes what, not how"                              | No → human review                              |
| Counts computed before paging                                  | No, semantic → human review                    |

The bottom three are the point. **Every real convention has a residue that tooling cannot
hold**, and each residual clause needs a recorded decision: accepted risk, human gate, or
dropped — with a name against it. A standard that pretends to be fully enforced is worse than
one that is honest about its edges, because people trust it further than it deserves.

## A template worth stealing

If you do write the convention down, give each procedure a header contract. It costs a few
lines and makes the structural clauses above checkable:

```sql
-- ============================================================
-- Procedure: usp_<Entity>_<Verb>
-- Purpose:   <one line — what it does, not how>
-- Mode:      READ | WRITE
-- Params:    @<Name> <type>   -- <meaning>
-- Returns:   <result shape, or ROWCOUNT>
-- Errors:    <named condition → what the caller sees>
-- NFR:       <link to the rule this obeys>
-- ============================================================
```

---

## Start here

1. Pick **one** rule you already have written down and cannot currently check.
2. Sort its clauses into mechanical and fuzzy.
3. Build the mechanical core as a nudge first. Watch what it catches for a week.
4. Promote it to a block only once you've seen it not fire on legitimate work.
5. Write down the residue, the bypass, and who owns each.

Step 5 is the one people skip, and it's the one that makes the rest trustworthy.
